    <h1 style="text-align:center;">USING HASKELL WITH 5- TO 7-YEAR-OLDS</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> Ian Benson and Jenny Cane show how Haskell helps learners to reason symbolically with 
        Cuisenaire-Gattegno Mathematics: a proven approach to teaching algebra before arithmetic</p>
        <p><img src="A.png" alt="Letter A" width="30" height="30">t Bursted Wood Primary School, 
        children in key stage 1 had already 
        embarked on a secure mathematical 
        journey, putting algebra at the heart of 
        the curriculum. The demands of the 2014 
        National Curriculum meant that in Year 1 
        children were expected to be taught to use 
        all four arithmetic operations, and fractions, 
        as operators. As a result, Bursted Wood 
        adopted a series of textbooks written by 
        Caleb Gattegno called Numbers in Colours. 
        These textbooks use Cuisenaire rods to 
        encourage the learner to explore patterns, 
        and then to give letter code names to the 
        patterns, and record the relationships 
        between them with equations. It is only 
        after the letter code exploration that they 
        finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. 
        white representing one), and transform 
        their equations into arithmetic. Very early 
        on in Year 1, children are able to read 
        and write a variety of complex algebraic</p>

        <p>equations using plus, minus, multiply, 
        and fractions as operators, and translate 
        these into arithmetic. The results had been 
        impressive throughout key stage 1. In 
        Year 2 we wanted to take it a step further 
        by running computing lessons using the 
        same use of natural language and level 
        of sophistication.</p>

        <h2>Why Haskell?</h2>

        <p>Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual 
            mathematics and number theory, the 
            inspiration for Gattegno Mathematics. It has 
            four attributes that make it particularly 
            appropriate for mathematics education:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Its syntax is very close to traditional 
            mathematical notation (but beware 
            that it can be too terse).</li>
            <li>Variables are statically typed, which 
            means that programmers are protected 
            by the compiler from passing invalid 
            information as an argument (input) or 
            output value.</li>
            <li>The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions 
            ‘lazily’, only when required. This makes 
            it possible to program infinite data 
            structures in finite memory.</li>
            <li>Information is passed from the arguments 
            to functions by pattern matching. This 
            is an intuitive way for programmers to 
            envisage and reason about the behaviour 
            of their programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Starting with a staircase</h2>
        <p>To start, we went back to a familiar pattern 
            that Gattegno introduces in the textbooks, 
            called a staircase. This is built from one rod 
            of each colour arranged in size order (figure 
            1). The children were able to physically build 
            the staircase. However, because they were 
            so familiar with the pattern, they could also 
            access it virtually, which would help with 
            debugging and logical reasoning later. 
            A role-play game to establish 
            computational thinking was introduced 
            before any actual programming began. This 
            allowed the children to familiarise themselves 
            with the function calls successor and 
            predecessor (succ, pred) while traversing 
            the staircase. The children would take turns 
            to ask each other questions such as succ 
            White (answer Red) or pred Orange
            (answer Blue). To help the children access 
            the new programming vocabulary, one child </p>

            size White, and its conjugate with every other rod removed" width="400" height="250">
        <p>would take the role of the ‘engine’ and the 
            other ‘interpreter’. This was extended to 
            succ $ succ (successor of successor) 
            which uses function composition $. Some 
            children could creatively enjoy inventing 
            functions such as succ $ succ $ succ 
            White to test the technique. The children 
            experimented by writing down their calls 
            before building themselves a rod calculator in 
            Haskell. The language soon became a natural 
            part of lessons and meant that it was easy to 
            progress to the next step.

            <p> <img src="sign.png" alt="sign" width="20" height="30">SOME CHILDREN COULD CREATIVELY ENJOY INVENTING FUNCTIONS</p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>Very soon the children were able to 
            construct their own rod calculator in 
            Haskell, by first constructing the engine 
            using the Colour data type. Then 
            the children asked the same role-play 
            questions, this time by typing the language 
            into the interpreter window. It soon 
            became apparent that errors in the engine 
            meant that the interpreter would not 
            run, and that this would require carefully 
            debugging and retyping. The children 
            could spot bugs in the engine because they 
            had already worked out the answer. The 
            staircase was a familiar pattern, so they 
            could predict what the output should be. 
            Children were also able to edit the 
            Colour data type to model odd or even 
            staircases and test their functions to see 
            what the effect would be on the derived 
            successor function. A transcript (see 
            insert) shows a pupil working with the
            number names for the rods, measured 
            with White rather than the colour names. 
            He becomes aware as he is speaking 
            that the version of the succ function 
            that works for a staircase with a step 
            size White is distinct from the version of 
            succ in an even staircase, and he corrects 
            himself. It is clear to see that he has 
            constructed an image of the staircase and 
            is virtually traversing it.</p>

        <h2>Calculating</h2>
        <p>To build the rod arithmetic calculator, 
            the pupil reuses the equations that they 
            studied in Year 1. Gattegno’s definitions 
            lie in the algebraic domain. Programming 
            illustrates the distinction between algebra 
            and arithmetic. Making this clear is crucial 
            to investigating the level of abstraction 
            that the learner has reached. The figure 
            shows a rod arithmetic calculator 
            constructed after four terms of Gattegno 
            Mathematics. The values associated 
            with the rod code letters are modelled 
            as constant functions in Haskell. Nine 
            equations are derived from Gattegno’s 
            equivalent expressions. The tenth, which 
            binds an integer value to the code for 
            White, shows the choice of measuring 
            unit, which fixes the values of the 
            other codes.
            By introducing Haskell to the 
            children we have been able to take 
            the mathematics that the children are 
            familiar with and successfully and 
            creatively introduce programming 
            functions. We have been able to provide 
            both the teacher and child with a rich 
            situation, allowing them to think both 
            mathematically and computationally. It is 
            exciting to think where our investigations 
            may lead us to next!</p>
