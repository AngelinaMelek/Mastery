                    At Bursted Wood Primary School, children in key stage 1 had already
                    embarked on a secure mathematical journey, 
                    putting algebra at the heart of the curriculum. The demands of the 2014 National Curriculum meant that in Year 1 
                    children were expected to be taught to use all four arithmetic operations, and fractions, 
                    as operators. As a result, Bursted Wood adopted a series of textbooks written by Caleb Gattegno called <i>Numbers in Colours</i>. 
                    These textbooks use Cuisenaire rods to encourage the learner to explore patterns, and then to give letter code names to the 
                    patterns, and record the relationships between them with equations. It is only after the letter code exploration that they 
                    finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. white representing one), and transform their equations into arithmetic. Very early 
                    on in Year 1, children are able to read and write a variety of complex algebraic

                    impressive throughout key stage 1. In Year 2 we wanted to take it a step further by running computing lessons using the

                <p>
                    Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual mathematics and number theory, the inspiration for Gattegno Mathematics. It has 
                    four attributes that make it particularly appropriate for mathematics education:
                </p>        
                <ul class="marking-list">
                    <li>Its syntax is very close to traditional mathematical notation (but beware that it can be too terse).</li>
                    <li>Variables are statically typed, which means that programmers are protected 
                    by the compiler from passing invalid information as an argument (input) or output value.</li>
                    <li>The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions 'lazily', only when required. This makes 
                    it possible to program infinite data structures in finite memory.</li>
                    <li>Information is passed from the arguments to functions by pattern matching. This 
                    is an intuitive way for programmers to envisage and reason about the behaviour of their programs.</li>

                <p>
                    To start, we went back to a familiar pattern that Gattegno introduces in the textbooks, called a staircase. This is built 
                    from one rod of each colour arranged in size order (figure 1). The children were able to physically build the staircase. 
                    However, because they were so familiar with the pattern, they could also access it virtually, which would help with 
                    debugging and logical reasoning later. A role-play game to establish computational thinking was introduced 
                    before any actual programming began. This allowed the children to familiarise themselves with the function calls successor 
                    and predecessor (succ, pred) while traversing the staircase. The children would take turns 
                    to ask each other questions such as succ White (answer Red) or pred Orange (answer Blue). To help the children access 
                    the new programming vocabulary, one child

                    would take the role of the 'engine' and the other 'interpreter'. This was extended to 
                    <code>succ $ succ</code> (successor of successor) which uses function composition $. Some children 
                    could creatively enjoy inventing functions such as <code>succ $ succ $ succ White</code> to test the technique. 
                    The children experimented by writing down their calls before building themselves a rod calculator in Haskell. 
                    The language soon became a natural part of lessons and meant that it was easy to progress to the next step.

                        Very soon the children were able to construct their own rod calculator in Haskell, by first constructing the engine 
                        using the <code>Colour</code> data type. Then the children asked the same role-play questions, this time by typing the 
                        language into the interpreter window. It soon became apparent that errors in the engine meant that the interpreter would not

                        run, and that this would require carefully debugging and retyping. The children could spot bugs in the engine because 
                        they had already worked out the answer. The staircase was a familiar pattern, so they could predict what the output should be. 
                        Children were also able to edit the <code>Colour</code> data type to model odd or even staircases and test their functions to 
                        see what the effect would be on the derived <code>successor</code> function. A transcript (see insert) shows a pupil working

                        that the version of the succ function that works for a staircase with a step size White is distinct from the version of 
                        <code>succ</code> in an even staircase, and he corrects himself. It is clear to see that he has constructed an image of

                To build the rod arithmetic calculator, the pupil reuses the equations that they studied in Year 1. Gattegno's definitions 
                lie in the algebraic domain. Programming illustrates the distinction between algebra and arithmetic. Making this clear is 
                crucial to investigating the level of abstraction that the learner has reached. The figure shows a rod arithmetic calculator 
                constructed after four terms of Gattegno Mathematics. The values associated with the rod code letters are modelled 
                as constant functions in Haskell. Nine equations are derived from Gattegno's equivalent expressions. The tenth, which 
                binds an integer value to the code for White, shows the choice of measuring unit, which fixes the values of the other codes.
                By introducing Haskell to the children we have been able to take the mathematics that the children are 
                familiar with and successfully and creatively introduce programming functions. We have been able to provide 
                both the teacher and child with a rich situation, allowing them to think both mathematically and computationally. It is 
                exciting to think where our investigations may lead us to next!
